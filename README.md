Project Description

In this project we wanted to create a simple two player game that follow the universal rules of hangman. The two players play against each other, the first choosing a word the other has to guess, but if he does not do so, he loses. Instead of using chalk and a black board, the players can input their word letters etc. in this programm, which will work with the input accoridng to hangman rules and present the corresponding output. Creating this project, we applied our python knowledge learnt during the first week of the DA Ironhack bootcamp.

Rules

1. Player 1 inputs a word the other player has to guess.
2. Player 2 inputs a letter.
3. If this letter is a letter of the inputted word, the letter will be presented in the correct position inside the word.
4. If the letter is not a letter of the inputted word, Player 2 loses 1 life: The new number of life will be displayed as well as graphic picturing the amount of lives lost.
5. If letter has already been mentioned, Player 2 will be informed about that.
6. Step 2 - 5 will be repeated until either the word has been guessed (Player 2 wins) or all of the lives have been

Workflow

We began planning our project via jira and set up different stages with sub tasks we would have to go through during the development of this project, such as creating a planning foundation, starting to code etc. We then started going through these stages and subtasks one by one. Especially in the coding stage, we mainly worked together on one file. Taking into account that this was our first project, we felt more comfortable working on the same code then simultaniously working on the same project on different parts of the code. But of course, we have set this to be a goal for future projects.

Organization

We set up our plan on how to tackle the challenge via jira. Multiple checkpoints of our work were created on the way as well as various files in which we focused on different experiments on how to solve problems we solved. These were then frequently pushed up to our github so the remote repository and both team members were always on the same page regarding the process of the work.

Our Project1 repository consists of the REDAME, gitignore file as well as a presentation of our flowchart of how the game works and a picture of our innitial plan constructed on jira. Additionally we added two folders. The first folder includes all the files with different checkpoints we made on the way as well as various files with experiments we made on the code in order to be able to track our workflow along the way. The second folder consists of the file with our finished final work and included explanations on the steps in the code
